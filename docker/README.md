# [Doujinshi manager](https://ryoga-chan.github.io/djmngr-hp/)

This software is made for doujin/manga/comics/novel readers and photographers to
manage a collection of zipped image sets, easying their work with sorting
files, assigning metedata, searching, and reading online from any device.

Populate your collection and:

* browse it on desktop or mobile devices (a simple **alternative interface** is
  also available for low-end devices like e-readers and old browsers)
* browse by **metadata** with optional filters
* search by title and its translation
* search by **cover similarity**
* **visually compare** multiple sets
* view a **random sample** of images within a ZIP file
* view zipped images directly **in browser**, or in you preferred application,
  or by downloading the ZIP/CBZ file
* create and download a **custom resolution EPUB** for each of your devices
* check ZIP **file integrity** and verify its checksum
* create and manage **shelves** of ZIP files
* assign a **score** and set **favorite** ZIP files
* ...much more!
